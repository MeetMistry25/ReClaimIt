- All actions are logged and require confirmation

### Token Management
- Admin tokens are stored in localStorage
- Automatic logout on token expiration
- Secure token validation on all requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Access denied" error**
   - Ensure you're using admin credentials
   - Check if your account is blocked
   - Verify admin role in database

2. **"User not found" error**
   - Refresh the page and try again
   - Check if the user was deleted by another admin

3. **"Failed to load" errors**
   - Check server connection
   - Verify admin token is valid
   - Try logging out and back in

### Database Issues

1. **Admin user not created**
   - Run `npm run create-admin` again
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify User model exists

2. **Permission errors**
   - Ensure admin role is set to 'admin' in database
   - Check if status is 'active'
